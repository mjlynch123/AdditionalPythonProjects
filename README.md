Random Small Python Projects

This is where I will post my small projects that don't need their own repository.

This README will be updated will new projects everytimes with a description of what it does.

1. Divisors.py - Takes an integer between 1 and 30 as an input. We then take that number and run it through a range between 1 and 1000 and then append all of the divisors of the given number to a list to then print out. (Project from practicepython.org)

2. listOverlap.py - Takes two lists and find the numbers that are in common with each list or the intersection and prints them out. (Project from practicepython.org)
